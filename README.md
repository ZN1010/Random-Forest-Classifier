# Random-Forest-Classifier
This project serves as a part of the homework from CSE 6242 (Data and Visual Analytics at Georgia Tech, Spring 2019) at https://poloclub.github.io/cse6242-2019spring-campus/. \
I implement a random forest classifier in Python3 without using existing machine learning or random forest libraries like scikit-learn.
## Description
By using information gain to perform the splitting in the decision tree, a random forest classifier is built to classify if a molecule is biodegradable or not based on given attributes of the molecule. The dataset is extracted from the [QSAR biodegradation Data Set]  (http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/QSAR+biodegradation).
